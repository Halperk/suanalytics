In that respect, women and children as individuals, and family, as a social entity were kept out of research and analysis for a long time. In the 1960s, however, social history had a pioneering and remarkable role as a major authority to change the status quo. Gender, childhood, and family came to be considered as significant sites of analysis and the consecutive decades brought about the formation of them into significant fields of inquiry. History of family, history of childhood, and gender history grew considerably in time and the last three decades have produced discrete historical studies that provide richly detailed accounts on these issues. Parallel with this trend, this course will specifically focus on family, gender, and childhood in Europe in order to provide an alternative version of studying European history."]}
