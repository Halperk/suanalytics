Sophisticated computational techniques are developed with the goal of estimating and making inferences about the geometric and dynamic properties of the 3D world around us. A tentative list of topics for the course includes: review of camera models/calibration, review of projective geometry, introductory differantial geometry, 3D object reconstruction from two (multiple) views, volumetric 3D reconstruction, 2D and 3D motion estimation, image stitching/panorama, fetaure extraction and matching (sift,...), image inpainting , image blending/compositing, and other state-of-the-art 3D vision topics. The course will provide the participants with an up to date back ground in 3Dimensional computer vision."]}
