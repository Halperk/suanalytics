Specifically, it defines the terminology and presents the various verbal, graphic, and algebraic methods for describing systems-their structures, functions, flows, interactions, decision rules, alternative solution options and behaviour. It discusses methods for acquisition of both 'hard' and 'soft' data, the various formal aids to creative thinking, the art of systems analysis, and the strategies for implementing system studies. The emphasis throughout this JIT module will be on finding, defining, and structuring the real managerial problems within the organization for a creative and implementable solution.  It is intended for line management and for staff analysts concerned with designing, planning, operating and or managing of business and service organizations."]}
