With the rise of global capitalism, developing countries such as China, India, Brazil and Turkey have experienced a remarkable economic growth in the last 20 years. However, this fast economic growth comes along with its downsides such as the dramatic rise in income inequality, violation of human rights, suppression of unionized workers, worsening conditions at work, and unemployment. In this social and political context, through a close examination of various ethnographic cases, this course aims to introduce major theoretical and critical approaches to global capitalism, development, social change, and social justice."]}
