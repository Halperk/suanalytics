It is this dimension of representation that is seized upon and developed into a larger and more complicated notion by Cultural Studies, which is concerned with ways of \"reading culture\". This comprises investigating the production, reception and use of all contemporary forms of symbolic representation and communication viewed as \"cultural texts\". CULT 212 is an introduction to textual analysis, and is also closely connected with contemporary literary criticism. The course explores how cultural meanings are transmitted through different media, ranging from the written word and the still image to the most sophisticated forms of electronic communication. Case studies are utilized to explore methods of discourse analysis, with students undertaking their own research projects in which they \"read\" a \"text\" of their own choice that may be drawn from words, images, sounds or performances surrounding us, including video clips, poetry, paintings, buildings, dress, manners or body decoration."]}
