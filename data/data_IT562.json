Students will be able to get a grasp of fundamental issues and be able to compare and contrast the approaches.  The first part of the course covers Object-Oriented Concepts, Analysis and Design. Part two covers SOA concepts and the part three introduces programming SOA applications with examples. Part I : Object-oriented Analysis and Design using UML The objective of this part is to provide the basics of object-oriented software engineering including object-oriented analysis and design using UML. Topics covered: Fundamental concepts of software design & UML (Unified Modeling Language), Requirement analysis, UML notations, Use case diagrams, Class diagrams and Case studies. Part II : SOA Principles This part is an introduction to key concepts and issues associated with SOA and provides an overview of SOA based software lifecycle, development and technologies. Students will be introduced to the fundamental elements of SOA Concepts, Analysis and Design along with a brief overview of Web services, Services and Component Development, Business Process Management, Enterprise Services Bus technologies."]}
