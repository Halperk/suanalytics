Geometric-modeling topics are transformations, rendering, solid modeling, curves and surfaces, and volumetric properties. Numerical methods for analysis include overview of numerical methods such as finite differences and finite-elements, solution methods of linear system of equations. Design optimization includes search methods, constrained optimization multi-disciplinary optimization, and manufacturing tolerances. The course concludes with CAM and its applications."]}
