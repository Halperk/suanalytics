This course will be review of those arguments and of the situations from which they arise and on which they comment. What has art become if it cannot apparently escape from institutional determination? How have artists and writers responded to these situations? The course will enable  a critical review of the problematic of art and institutions initially by defining the problems and difficulties that institutions raise for art, as a prelude to assessing possibilities of the reverse."]}
