In rap music, internet blogs, puppetry and bilingual theater, as well as in the more traditional genres of literature and poetry, the course looks at how migrants and their descendents use cultural work to explore questions of identity, citizenship and community. The course may include work by migrants in and across Europe, the Americas, Asia or Africa; it will also look at the transnational connections migrants make among these different spaces. Students are encouraged to discover and analyze new cultural production in any media, using the theoretical resources developed over the semester."]}
