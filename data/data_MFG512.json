At the first stage, vector & tensor properties and rules would be shown in order to establish a background for the students to earn advanced level mechanics problem solution capabilities. Later on large deformation theory in its general form will be explained and necessary equations for solid mechanics modeling like; conservation of energy, conservation of momentum will be discussed in detail. Elastic material models and relations for different Isotropic and Orthotropic materials will be explained within the course. Introductory level plasticity which covers the basic relationships for a plastically deforming solid will be provided within the course. Solution of continuum problems with finite element methods will be illustrated and example 1D finite element problem solution methodology will be shown in detail."]}
