Specifically for the 15th and 16th centuries, HIST 561 is arranged topically to review the political organization of a dynastic state, the social structures of townsmen, peasants and nomads, as well as the relationships between political authority and various social groups. The wider context of Ottoman lands in Europe and in West Asia is then considered in relation to ideology and political thought.
