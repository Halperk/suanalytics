Various approaches to requirements analysis in the context of project initiation, evaluation and selection are considered. Network analysis and scheduling techniques include that of Critical Path Method (CPM), CPM/COST, and Programme Review and Control Technique (PERT).  A computerized project management tool will be introduced. Concepts of system life cycle costing, cost estimation methods, concepts of cost estimation relationships and software cost estimation models are reviewed. Trade-off analysis of time-cost and performance including the impact of systems characteristics are analyzed."]}
