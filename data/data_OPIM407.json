Specifically, at the end of this course each student should develop: a)  Knowledge about managerial decision making, business intelligence, decision support systems and how they relate to other types of information systems. b) Knowledge about DSSdevelopment methodologies and enabling technologies (such as Analytical Hierarchy Processes, Group Support Systems, Expert Systems, Neural Networks, Knowledge Management, Data Warehousing and Data Mining) c) Knowledge about DSS enabling software packages -a general understanding and some hands-on capabilities.", "The main objective of this course is to present predictive and prescriptive analytics tools in the context of business cases, with an emphasis on implementing analytical approaches within an organization. Throughout this course, students will learn: use tools and ideas from Analytics and Râ€™s environment to solve interesting and exciting business problems; learn how to formulate relevant business questions that can be answered using data; understand the various steps of data preparation like data cleaning and feature extraction; develop and test hypotheses to inform managerial decisions and to collaborate meaningfully with multiple stakeholders; evaluate the effectiveness of a solution through statistical learning methods (supervised & unsupervised methods); communicate results to both technical and non-technical audiences."]}
