Information-carrying networks of interacting proteins and genes as well as nonoscale molecular machines converting chemical energy to mechanical work will be examined. State-of-the-art experimental techniques to study these biological and biochemical circuits will be introduced. Mathematical models will be developed to arrive at general principles of information and energy processing in molecular biology."]}
