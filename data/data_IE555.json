We will analyze the inefficiencies due to decentralized decision-making in a supply chain. We will study how different contract forms can be used to mitigate these inefficiencies by coordinating the actions of chain members. To this end, we will use game-theory and contract-theory frameworks from Economics in addition to inventory theory from Operations Management. We will have lectures as well as discussions on research papers. The course is designed primarily for masters/doctoral students interested in supply chain management research."]}
