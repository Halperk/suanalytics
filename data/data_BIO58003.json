It ensures non-selective or selective engulfment of cellular components, including long-lived proteins, protein aggregates and even whole organelles (e.g. mitochondria), and their degradation in lysosomes. As such, autophagy serves as a major recycling mechanism in cells. Under stress conditions, autophagy is upregulated and supports cell survival by limiting cellular damage. Conversely, under certain conditions, excessive autophagy might contribute to cell death. Several diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease), cancer and infectious diseases were found to involve autophagy abnormalities. In this course, molecular mechanisms of autophagy will be discussed in detail. Autophagy-disease connections will also be studied. Moreover, the course offers students an opportunity to revise and discuss basic concepts in molecular biology, cell biology, biyokimya and medical research."]}
