The field, which borrows extensively from the social sciences, includes but is not limited to, topics such as motivation, decision making, leadership, organizational culture, communication, organizational conflict, power and negotiation, team processes, organization change, structure and change. This course is based on a belief that social science has much to offer the practicing manager and that becoming an effective manager of others requires increasing our own self-awareness and a portfolio of managerial skills. Thus, the course combines traditional lectures with the use of cases, group projects and experiential exercises."]}
