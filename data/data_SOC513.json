In the second part basic schools of thought (like blue Anatolia) and the ideas and arguments of the prominent thinkers and intellectuals will be analyzsed. in this regard new understanding of the social and the political will be dissected with special reference to such debates as, modernity, postmodernity, secularism, political Islam, Europe, globalisation. An extensive review of Turkish literature in this context is imperative."]}
