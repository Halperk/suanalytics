It discusses selected works of art, architecture, literature, and cinema from the nineteenth century to the twenty-first.  Where appropriate, as with the Bayeux Tapestry and the Overlord Embroidery, medieval sources of inspiration will be brought into the discussion to problematize the relationship between the imaginary of the Middle Ages that was appropriated and reenacted, and the dynamics behind the production of the medieval work of art.  In cases where connections are not immediate (the works of J. R R. Tolkien), or where the source of inspiration is itself imaginary (the Legend of King Arthur), the emphasis will be on different modes of the imaginary at play in medieval and modern contexts."]}
