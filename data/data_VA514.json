This course will explore the possibilities of understanding the modern not as a single event but as a series of breaks in tradition or orientation in art, openning up possibilties of understanding the particularities of modern visual art in Turkey as well as elsewhere. Comparative perspectives will therefore be encouraged so that students may develop critical vocabularies  for assessing different art from different cultural situations and moments."]}
