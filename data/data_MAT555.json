Structures and properties will be discussed, along with the prototypes of organic materials. Design of molecules and materials with electronic, magnetic and electrochromic properties based on structural analysis is an important aspect. Selected current topics include nanostructured materials, functional materials, new approaches to polymer synthesis and device fabrication, and bio-related materials."]}
