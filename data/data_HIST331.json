After a chronological review of the political processes of expansion, state-formation, and decentralization, various aspects of social and intellectual life are examined. Topics to be covered include : the question of unity and diversity in Islamic history; the development of the religious sciences, law, political thought and philosophy; social hierarchies in theory and practice; and economic life and thought. For the possibility of being taken as a graduate course, subject to additional readings and work requirements, see HIST 531."]}
