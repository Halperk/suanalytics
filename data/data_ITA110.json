The instructional approach is directed towards the development of everyday communication. Students also develop basic knowledge in grammar, lexis, and phonology. By the end of this level, students will be able to talk about their preferences, daily routines and schedules, work life, spare time activities, sports, shopping, social activities, celebrations and personal relationships, using the grammar rules and vocabulary they have learned. They will also be able to make comparisons, describe their moods, and express feelings and opinions as well as their experiences and future plans, using simple syntactic structures."]}
