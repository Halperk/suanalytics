Specific topics include: selected topic in linear control systems; typical nonlinear problems and phenomena; stability; Lyapunov theory; robustness; performance analysis; nonlinear control design. Laboratory project will be provided to emphasize the the applicability of the theoretical results.", "The course emphasizes the fundamental concepts in finite element analysis, and practical implementation of a working program. The course is divided into two halves. The first half is concentrated on the basic theoretical of the finite element method. The second half will be focused on issues concerning the implementation. Advanced topics will be discussed if time permits. The methods studied in this course are practical procedures that are employed extensively in the mechanical, civil, ocean, aeronautical and electrical industries. Increasingly, the methods are used in computer-aided design."]}
