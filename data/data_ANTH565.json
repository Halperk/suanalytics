It will examine the dynamics of massive revolutionary movements, and yet also the challenges of understanding diverse and less-publicized forms of protest and mobilization.  We will examine forms of protest related to human rights, labor conditions, indigenous mobilization, ethnicity and nationalism, religion and gender in the context of increasing globalization.  The course will both explore particular case studies of mobilization as well as introduce students to key questions about the role of culture, memory, mass media, and other forces in the making of social mobilization."]}
