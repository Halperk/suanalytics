We will examine how receptors are engaged by their ligands, cytoplasmic signaling events, activation of new gene transcription, tissue specificity of gene transcription and cell death pathways. The course is designed to provide  an advanced understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the signal transduction in development, disease and stres conditions."]}
