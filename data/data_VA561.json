In this course illustration will be taken to refer to the visual representation of certain moods or attitudes through these media. Students will have the opportunity to learn various illustration techniques and experiment on creating their own style. Projects may vary, but will include (at least) illustrating texts for posters and character development for a book of fairy tales. By the end of the semester students will have added to their portfolios, as well as to their expertise and self-confidence in experimenting with and using illustration for further visual projects."]}
