It helps to identify the relationship between target customer, their needs, customer's change of behaviour depending on their changing perception, and the effect of this change to the brand. From strategic design to implementation decisions, a complete study is applied in the course. In order to bridge the gap between marketing strategy concepts and strategy designing, Big Picture management is implemented on different markets and brand dynamics through simulation or applied case studies."]}
