In the peace time interactions negotiation is an essential mechanism to achieve constructive solutions, and mutually satisfactory agreements. International actors- states, non governmental actors, firms, and their representatives- often negotiate to settle their differences, to build new systems of interactions, and to renew trust. This course is designed to provide the students with the essentials of the art and science of negotiation. The first part of the course will introduce basic components, concepts and contexts of international negotiation. In this section, the nature of negotiation, prenegotiation, preparing for negotiation, power, strategies, and tactics, gender and the impact of culture, multilateral negotiation will constitute some of the issues to be discussed. Part two is concerned with hands-on negotiation games and simulations.  The course will be conducted through lectures, participatory discussions, simulation exercises, and seminars by experienced diplomats."]}
