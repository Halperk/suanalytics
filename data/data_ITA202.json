The students at this point will be able to exchange information, ask for and give advice, ask for and give help, express desires and preferences, speak about projects and programs in their future on a more complex and sophisticated level. This is will be achieved through language support based on vocabulary, class practice, complex interactive and everyday situations with a constant awareness of the learning processes involved. The students are expected to give an oral presentation on an approved topic of their choice. Special attention will be given to several aspects of Italian culture, according to students' interests and desires."]}
