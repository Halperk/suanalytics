Why do states establish supranational and international institutions, and what determines both their design and evolution? How do international and domestic forces impact their effectiveness and function? This course provides an in-depth look at the theory behind and practice of IOs and focuses on both theoretical and methodological issues related to IOs. It looks at the interaction between international law and politics as exemplified by the United Nations, international financial institutions (the IMF and World Bank), selected regional organizations (NATO and EU), and the WTO. Finally, and considers their substantive work in areas such as the promotion of democracy, peace and security, human rights, and sustainable development. Primary goal is to understand the interplay between interests, institutions and information in defining how IOs influence world politics."]}
