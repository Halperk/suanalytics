In the first part of the course; the main theoretical structure of Modern Portfolio Theory will be introduced by covering Markowitz mean- variance optimization and risk-return trade-off, basic financial market organization and functioning, equilibrium models and by giving some background information about traditional asset classes; namely fixed income secrities and equities. After this theoretical introduction; practical investment management concepts; such as Portfolio Management Process and Investment Policy Statement, formation of capital market expectations, strategic/tactical asset allocation will be summarized in the second part of the course.
