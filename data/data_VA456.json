The prevalence of design as a ritualistic element of cultural activities and its critical analysis is grounded on the most prevalent comparative evaluations of art and design theories and their inferences. Central questions include: what kind of relationships exist between design-based activities and art  practices?,Which reciprocal activities generate the outcomes between design and technology?, How do these relationships affect the cultural-map of specific habitations and social locations?, How can one read cultural identities through decoding the design elements of the product-lines?, Which design elements of the product embodied historical evolution of the cultural exchanges?"]}
