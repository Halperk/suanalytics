How is it different from mainstream practices and other types of works? What are its close ties to other art practices? This course will be a comprehensive study of experimental film and video through screenings, readings, discussions, and creative practice. It will offer a critical exploration of the history and theory of experimental and avant-garde film and video, including the impact of new technologies and current practices. Students will create a series of short experimental videos to explore new ways to express themselves."]}
