The focus will be on three main philosophical approaches; critical, hermeneutical and genealogical. By relying mainly on primary sources, the course will attempt to thoroughly explore each of these understandings. The focus will be on their respective methodologies as well as on their substantive claims about the modern period. Furthermore, the course will also explore how these three approaches engage and criticize each other."]}
