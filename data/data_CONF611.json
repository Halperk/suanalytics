We will explore the systematic attempts to understand the relationship of cultural difference and conflict both in theory and in practice. The aim of the course is to integrate international conflict resolution methods and culture as they pertain to different conflict zones. In this course we will study this emerging literature and field of study and practice. We will critically evaluate its usefulness in confronting contemporary global political and humanitarian challenges. Specific attention will be given to such cultural causes as ethnicity, language, race, and gender in the development and resolution of conflict in domestic and international arenas."]}
