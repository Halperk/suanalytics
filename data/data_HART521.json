Students may expect to consider works by Courbet, Manet, Monet, CÃ©zanne, Picasso, Braque, Matisse, Malevich, Mondrian, Duchamp.

The changing relations between notions of modernity and the aims of artists and their works is reviewed. The significance of movements in art, such as romanticism, realism, impressionism, and post-impressionism, towards the development of `modern art' is assessed. Students may expect to consider works by key artists such as Delacroix, Ingres, Turner, Constable, Courbet, Manet, Monet, Cezanne, Gauguin, Seurat, Van Gogh. Notions of modernity and modernism in art will be examined as part of a consideration of the aims of modern art, social, political or otherwise."]}
