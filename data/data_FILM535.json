The history of non-fiction film or documentary cinema, is a series of experimentations in the representation of reality. Since the beginning, with these experimentations, debates about ethical, aesthetic, political issues in representation have been unfolding. This course will offer a critical look at the historical development of non-fiction film forms and modes. We will cover documentary theories and criticism, and related issues including ethics and problematics of representation. Students will work on a series of short video exercises and write a series of short responses to the films and the readings. At the end of the semester, students are expected to submit a term paper and a proposal for a project to be implemented next semester."]}
