At the vanguard was Bauhaus, the school and movement that merged art, architecture, and design into a style free from the bonds of history and national boundaries. Bauhaus was truly an international art for a new age. This course looks at the key moments in the history of Bauhaus against the cultural and intellectual backdrop of interwar Europe and treats them within the wider context of modernism. It covers a variety of related art, architecture and design movements starting briefly with an overview of the origins of modernism in the work of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement and Art Nouveau and concluding with important movements such as Constructivism, Cubism, De Stijl, New Objectivity, Suprematism and Futurism."]}
