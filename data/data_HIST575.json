Venturing to deconstruct colonial discourses and representations, Postcolonial Studies has had a deep imprint on humanities and social sciences in the last decades, and familiarity with it has become crucial to handling  research literature on the Middle East. Given academic developments over the last forty years, of equal importance to scholars in this field is a viable Postorientalist approach. Along with Edward Said’s path-breaking work, students will also gain insight into other dimensions of postcolonial literature, such as Subaltern Studies originating in the attempt of South Asian scholars to come to terms with the legacy of British rule. The last third of the term will focus on applying all such theoretical insights to Middle Eastern, Ottoman and Turkey studies."]}
