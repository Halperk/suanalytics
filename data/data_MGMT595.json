Although all steps of the course must be approved by the supervising faculty member, students are nonetheless expected to take primary responsibility for their own learning, including developing a reading list and forms of evaluation. Students may enroll in this course only after they have received the approval in writing of the faculty member with whom they would like to work."]}
