When complete members of an organization seek to inquire into the working of their own organizational or community system in order to change something in it and generate actionable knowledge, they can be understood as undertaking Insider Action Research. Complete membership is contrasted with those who enter a system temporarily for the sake of conducting research. It may be defined in terms of wanting to remain a member within a desired career path when the research is completed. Insider Action Research offers a unique perspective on systems, precisely because it is from the inside. The context of Insider Action Research is the strategic and operational setting that organizational members confront in their working lives. Issues of organizational concern, such as systems improvement, organizational learning, the management of change and so on are suitable subjects for Insider Action Research, since (a) they are real events which must be managed in real time, (b) they provide opportunities for both effective action and learning, and (c) they can contribute to the development of theory of what really goes on in organizations.
