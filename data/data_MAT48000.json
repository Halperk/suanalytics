The analysis and modification of surfaces to be bonded are critical first steps for the design and selection of proper adhesives in light of theories of adhesion. Chemical and physical concepts in adhesives play an important role in understanding their melt and solid state transitions, thermal and mechanical properties, and crystallization, viscoelastic, rheological or physical aging behaviors. Characterization methods for thermal and physical testing of adhesives and adhesively bonded assemblies are necessary for a thorough understanding of the application performance of various adhesives. Throughout this course, students will gain strong knowledge on (i) the understanding of the adhesion phenomena and the design adhesives for various substrates; (ii) thermal and mechanical characterization of adhesives and adhesively bonded assemblies to establish structure-property relationships for various applications."]}
