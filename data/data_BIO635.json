With recent advances in the field, nano materials and nano particles start to be widely used in all fields of life. In order to avoid eventual health problems, documentation of the effects of nano particles and materials on organisms and cells is of utmost importance. During the nanotoxicology course, the effects of nano particles and materials on human health and, stress, disease and death responses of the organisms and cells to nano particles and materials will be analyzed and discussed from a molecular biology perspective. Nano particles/materials in industry and in the environment, methods to study nanotoxicology, organismal responses to nanomaterials, entry-uptake, faith of nano particles in cells and cellular and molecular stress and death responses against them will be covered during the course."]}
