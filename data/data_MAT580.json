Describing possibly the most essential of knowledge bases, this course arms its enrollees with the tools necessary to carry out research effectively in applied areas.Background information of syntheses will be provided, followed with biweekly assignments related to the practice and problems of synthesis. Students will be rigorously encouraged to develop practical approaches, problem-solving skills, and critical insight into hypothetical situations. Apart from the above-mentioned practical aspects, the concepts of experimental design and scientific method will remain as central themes. Most importantly, attendants of the course can look forward applying their sharpened skills in their graduate research, particularly for devising and pursuing their own protocols.", ""]}
