After focusing on the debate on the nature of international law and its political and historical underpinnings, it will explore the sources of international law and the relations between international and municipal law. States and governments, international organisations, companies and individuals will be examined as subjects of international law. More specific issues, such as treatment of aliens, jurisdiction, treaties, state succession, the law of the Sea, air and outer space and will examine human rights, peaceful settlement of interstate disputes, and the law of war will complete the agenda of this course."]}
