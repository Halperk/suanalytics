It provides a background starting from the digitalization at shop floor level to the analysis of the gathered data to support decision making process. In the first lectures, the methods and hardware for data collection are covered. Labview is used for practical demonstrations and applications. The necessary calculations for conversion of the analog signal to digital signal are taught. After these basics, the evolution of the manufacturing science is reviewed and the link with the digitization is defined. As a next step, several digitalization methods are covered under the Digital Twin topic. Finally, digital transformation is reviewed from a more general perspective. The topics covered during the course will be applied through a term project. The students will make two presentations; one for reporting their progress and one for their final report they will submit."]}
