The Additive Manufacturing is defined as the process of adding materials layer-by-layer to manufacture parts from three-dimensional (3D) computer models. Additive Manufacturing also called Layered Manufacturing, 3D Printing or Solid Freeform Fabrication is considered one of the next-manufacturing revolution. The topics covered include various additive manufacturing processes and their process principles, the materials used, computer- aided design and path planning for additive manufacturing processes, process-related limitations and constraints and applications of Additive Manufacturing. The course also includes several related hands-on projects."]}
