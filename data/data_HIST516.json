And yet, barely two decades after its fall, the set of theories and practices that was once regarded as \" the future of humanity\" lies almost forgotten. HIST 516 is an attempt to think back from the early 21st century to the concrete visage and historical legacy of Marxism in power, exploring especially the party that was its chief instrument, the theories through which it eternalized its dictatorship, fostered a permanent culture of \"the enemy\" and legitimized its purges, as well as the daily structures of living perpetually in an atmosphere of abnormal politics, with a new social contract of basic services but without any fundamental, constitutionally guaranteed rights and political empowerment."]}
