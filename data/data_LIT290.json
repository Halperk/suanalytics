It is generally accepted that the novel and short story writing in Turkish literature started with the imitation of Western models during the 19th century modernization process. This course will analyze the development of Turkish fiction between 1870-1920 with the problematization of this accepted evaluation. We will scrutinize the interaction of Ottoman-Turkish fiction with the traditional genres as well as the Western impact, the role of translation and adaptation, the conflict between different approaches to fiction and the impact of the historical context through the reading of literary and theoretical texts. The course will be in Turkish."]}
