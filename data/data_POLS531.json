The objective is to enable graduate students to create and critique sophisticated qualitative research designs in political science. In order to do so,  the seminar explores the techniques, strengths, and limitations of qualitative methods by scrutinizing the logic and application of comparative case-studies, process-tracing, and discourse analysis. The course further takes on epistemological issues in the social sciences such as causality, theory testing, case selection, inference, and the philosophy of social science.
