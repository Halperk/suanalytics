Many students of ethnicity and nationalism try to explain ethnic roots of conflicts and examine cases where these conflicts with various level of violence took place. In the conflict resolution field, there also emerged a body of literature on how to resolve conflicts. What are the causes of these conflicts? What are the strategies to prevent them? Why and how do they end? Can they be reconciled? What can the international community do to facilitate peaceful settlement? This course will provide the students with the analytical tools to tackle with these questions."]}
