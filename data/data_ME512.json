The course is divided into two halves. The first half is concentrated on the basic theoretical of the finite element method. The second half will be focused on issues concerning the implementation. Advanced topics will be discussed if time permits. The methods studied in this course are practical procedures that are employed extensively in the mechanical, civil, ocean, aeronautical and electrical industries. Increasingly, the methods are used in computer-aided design."]}
