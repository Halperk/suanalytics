Data mining (also known as knowledge discovery) is the process of analyzing data to identify not-so-obvious patterns and/or relationships by automatically searching large stores of data. The purpose of this course is to introduce the student to various data mining concepts, algorithms, and their applications to real-world business problems."]}
