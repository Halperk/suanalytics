Through testing, one inspects behavior of a program on a finite set of test cases (a set of inputs, execution preconditions, and expected outcomes developed for a particular objective). To assure the quality of the project, testing must be considered and executed on all phases of Software Development Life Cycle. This is a critical task for all parties involved in the software project team including analysts, developers and testers. In this course, we will introduce all types of tests in different phases of SDLC such as, unit testing, functional and integrational testing, performance tests, user acceptance tests and adhoc testing. We will examine white box and black box testing formats along with test management formats and reporting. Automation tests and conditions will also be examined within the scope if this course. All lectures will be supported with practical examples and workshops."]}
