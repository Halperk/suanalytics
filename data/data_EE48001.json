After a brief review of VLSI design methodologies and current IC trends, fundamental challenges related to the conventional CMOS technologies are described. The shift from logic-centric to interconnect-centric design is emphasized. Primary aspects of an interconnect- centric design flow are described in four phases: (1) general characteristics of on-chip interconnects, (2) on-chip interconnects for data signals, (3) on-chip power generation and distribution, and (4) on-chip clock generation and distribution. Existing design challenges faced by IC industry are investigated for each phase. Tradeoffs among various design criteria such as speed-power-noise-area are highlighted. In the last phase of the course, several post-CMOS devices, emerging circuit styles, and architectures are briefly discussed. At the end of the course, the students will have a thorough understanding of the primary circuit and physical level design challenges with application to industrial IC design. )"]}
