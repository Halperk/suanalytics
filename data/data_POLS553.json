The approach is intended to be more analytical rather than historical and relying on the recent concepts emerging in the field of social theory. In this regard the course will discuss the issues of the post-1960 such as modernity, Kemalism, secularism, nationalism, left, extreme right, popular culture more with a political theory and philosophy view point and taking politics of identity and diffrence as a starting point.", "This course aims at contributing to the ability of students to analyze analytically and critically the diversities and vicissitudes of political institutions, actors, and discourses in Turkey, as well as, 'continuities and changes' in Turkish politics. In doing so, the course begins by discussing the question of how to approach methodologically to Turkish politics, and then proceeds by focusing on crucial problem areas, namely those of institutional problems, societal changes and demands, and identity questions.  The course attempts to discuss these issues and problems by locating them at the international/the domestic nexus.  To achieve its aim, the course involves lectures, class discussions, and class presentations, and requires both active student participation and reading course material before attending the lectures."]}
