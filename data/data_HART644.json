The first part of the course is an introduction into visual representation, style, iconography, and symbolism. Examples used include a comparative study of public and imperial imagery of ancient Rome, Napoleonic Europe, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The main part of the course focuses on subject matter, idioms and aesthetics systems in official architecture, public monuments and the fine and decorative arts perceived as representative of a nation's origins or cultural affiliation: from revivalist idioms (Gothic to Renaissance and Byzantine to Ottoman) to themes and idioms drawing from history, myth and folklore. The lectures will concentrate on case studies from Central Europe and the Balkans, but will include an overview of developments in the visual arts and architecture of England, Germany, France, Russia, and Turkey."]}
