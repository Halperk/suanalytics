With this view, Sublime Porte assumed a regulatory role toward the peripheral provincial population of Anatolia, the Balkans and the Arab lands (heterodox communities, tribal and nomadic groups). The era of reforms enhanced this role even further by adapting values of the European Enlightenment such as \"rational order\" and \"progress\". The provinces, on the other hand, used to be governed in the 17th and 18th centuries by local notables, in a de facto autonomous fashion. Thus, centralizing and regulatory policies of the reformist governments after 1774 created tensions between the center and the provinces. These tensions continued well into the late 19th century. This course aims to discuss this complex relationship between the center and the peripheral populations from the \"Classical Age\" onwards and focusing on topics such as the Nizâm-ı Cedîd reforms, Mahmud II's policies of centralization and provincial resistance, the issue of frontier regions (Bosnia, Albania, Kurdistan), the problem of the sedentarization of tribal/nomadic populations, and ideological steps to integrate peripheral groups into the imperial framework (rule of Abdulhamid II and Second Constitutional Period)."]}
