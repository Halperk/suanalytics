Oral histories are spoken memories about the past recorded by oral historians in a dialgue with individuals providing testimony. The study of oral history allows us to examine events and experiences not recorded by history (based on the study of written documents), as well as to analyze and interpret the meaning of events and experiences to individuals in the present. In this course, students will learn the techniques of doing oral history, read selected case studies, and conduct an oral history project of their own."]}
