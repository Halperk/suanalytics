Concepts of simulation modeling and techniques of building simulation models are introduced followed by organization of simulation languages and modeling with Arena, a comprehensive simulation package with animation capabilities. Statistical aspects including input analysis, random variate generation, output analysis, and variance reduction techniques are the other topics covered. (Knowledge of Probability and Statistics is recommended)"]}
