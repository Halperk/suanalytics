Historical backgrounding lectures on these and other key phases or developments will be complemented with other, on site lectures in the course of study trips to leading Ottoman locations and monuments. For the possibility of proceeding from the ?taught course? components of HIST 371 to primary research at the advanced graduate level, see HIST 571."]}
