Course materials combine such literary works with theoretical and historical writings on Turkey, focusing on topics such as nationalism, gender, theories of third world narratives and aesthetics in a non-western context, canon-formation and the construction of a national canon, minority literatures, and prison literature. Compared to a introductory survey course on Turkish Literature (such as LIT 394), LIT 492 encourages in-depth analyses of fewer literary works. The authors to be covered include (but are not limited to) Ahmet Hamdi Tanpınar, Oğuz Atay, Orhan Pamuk, Adalet Ağaoğlu, Latife Tekin, Elif Şafak, Emine Sevgi Özdamar, Mehmet Uzun, and Mıgırdıç Margosyan. The language of instruction is Turkish. For the possibility of being taken simultaneously by graduate students, and of fulfilling the research seminar requirements in History in particular, see LIT 692."]}
