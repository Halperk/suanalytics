The course will revolve around a number of movies grouped around (a) themes ranging from war to religion or from royalty to peasant life; (b) periods ranging from Biblical times to World War II; (c) geographies extending from China to the Americas; and (d) production traditions ranging from Cinecitta to Hollywood. In each case, discussion will cover the historical period, event(s) or process(es) that the movie focuses on, as well as the role of the film-maker's vision in constructing that representation."]}
