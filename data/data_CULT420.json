Of special importance is how conceptions of time and space are shaped through the interaction of culture and technology.  The course will start with some specific examples of the 'old' technologies (eg. telephones or radios) to understand their social uses when they were new.  It will proceed to examine comparable processes in relation to 'new' technologies (eg. cell phones or home computers). Throughout, theoretical readings on the link between old/new technologies and the organization of time and space as critical dimensions of modernity and postmodernity will be discussed.", "This course studies the social, cultural, and institutional contexts of science and technology, using the perspectives and methods derived from the social sciences and the humanities. It examines the assumptions about the neutrality and autonomy of science and technology,  the distinction between the natural and the artificial, the social construction of knowledge, expertise and authority, and the relationships between human values, science and technology. The links among science, technology and the organization of time and space, as well as the changing conceptions of the self are discussed as critical dimensions of modernity and postmodernity"]}
