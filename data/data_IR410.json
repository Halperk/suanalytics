The fact that international security is generally about the threat and use of force, raises questions such as: What causes war? Do regime types matter for peace? Is nuclear proliferation necessarily a threat to international stability? Would the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Turkey bring more security to itself and the region? What is terrorism and how much of a threat does it constitute for states? Through these questions, this course equips students with multiple approaches along with a historically nuanced understanding of the challenges of our times."]}
