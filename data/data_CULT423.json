The promises of a 'digital age' are also demands - to get wired - and threats of being unable to understand the shifts brought about by the advent of new technologies and modes of communication. Debates about information and power, communication and speed, are not unprecedented. Indeed, perhaps all we may say about the new is that it is not simply what it may be said to be. This course will explore this question of the new, putting digital imagery into comparison with its forebears such as photography and film to see what may be new about digital culture for us."]}
