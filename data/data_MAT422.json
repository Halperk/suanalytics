Systems that form glasses are investigated, and their phase equilibria will be studied. The effects of different additives to glass technology and engineering are discussed in detail. Thus, a solid knowledge of glass formation and how the properties can be altered by chemistry and processing will be presented from a scientific and industrial points of view. Atomic mobility and deformation in glasses will be treated to gain insight into their mechanical, chemical and electrical properties and durability. The course will also focus on optical properties of various glasses."]}
