Some of the methods to be covered are x-ray spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy; there will also be sections on device characterization and hybrid materials. The students who would like to further develop their characterization knowledge are advised to take the continuation modules on materials characterization such as electron microscopy and thermal characterization."]}
