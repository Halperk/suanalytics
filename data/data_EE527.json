It will cover all fundamental elements of mechatronics systems as well as the role of mechanics-electronics- software in the mechatronics system design. The subject that will be discussed include: integration of mechanics- software into mechatronics systems, modeling and identification, measurement and sensors in mechatronics, power conversion and actuation principles in mechatronics systems, control and its role in mechatronics. The case studies will be presented and students will be asked to design and build a mechatronics product."]}
