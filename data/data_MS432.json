The first half of the course is dedicated to discrete-time models, the other half to their continuous-time counterparts. The topics covered include pricing and hedging in binomial models and Black-Sholes models, fundamental theorems of asset pricing, martingales, Brownian motion, stochastic integration, It√¥ rule. Depending on the progress in class, we also briefly discuss SDE?s as they appear in continuous-time models."]}
