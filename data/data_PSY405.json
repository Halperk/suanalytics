It uses a psychological, and at times cognitive scientific, lens to explore issues such as the relation of language and thought, narrative development, memory (individual and collective), emotion, morality, transmission of knowledge, concepts, implicit cognition. It will survey research and theory within social psychology, cognitive psychology, linguistics, and cross-cultural psychology and provide implications from and for philosophy, anthropology, literature, artificial intelligence, and politics. This course is also concerned with methodological and theoretical challenges in the integration of cultural perspectives in psychology"]}
