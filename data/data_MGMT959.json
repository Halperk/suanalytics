Through experiential learning, case analyses, and individual and group projects, the students develop an understanding of what culture is (and what it is not), and how it shapes human cognition, emotion and motivation in ways that influence cross-cultural communication, particularly with respect to leadership, teamwork, and conflict management. Consequently, the students are expected to better understand their own assumptions as well as recognize and predict others' cultural mindsets. The course also covers human resource management in global firms, with a particular focus on international career development."]}
