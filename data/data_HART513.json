This has been a transition from a certain understanding of visuality to the Western type of visuality. However, the social background of this transition is still obscure. The course aims to discuss the early problems of the 19th century and the developments of the Republican era with a peculiar emphasis on the social and cultural issues. In the second part of the term, the course will be open to some contemporary artists and their presentations.", "\"Visual Art in Turkey\" is an overall historical survey on Turkish visual arts from the late 19th century to the present. Framing issues of tradition, modernity, postmodernity, contemporaneity within a chronological trajectory, the course aims to introduce students to the changes in artistic production in relation to cultural changes in Turkish society in the 20th century. Historical and cultural shifts relating to artistic identity, artistic trends, and artworks are taken into focus to reflect the transformation of the artistic sphere and visual culture in modern Turkey."]}
