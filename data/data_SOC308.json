It starts with the classical writings of Troeltsch, Durkheim, Weber, and Geertz, and seeks to answer the following questions using empirical cases drawn from Europe, the United States, Turkey, and India: Why do different societies experience different degrees of secularization? How do church-state relations and secular ideologies vary from one setting to another? Can secularism itself be considered a religion-like formation? What is civil religion?  What role does religion play in social movements, and civil societies?"]}
