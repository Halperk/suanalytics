The course explores the different ways in which war and political violence are remembered through a gender lens.  Central questions include: what are the gendered effects of war, political violence, and militarization? How have wars, genocide and other forms of political violence been narrated and represented? How do women remember and narrate gendered violence in war? How are post-conflict processes and transitional justice gendered? What is the relationship between testimony, storytelling, and healing? How is the relationship between the ''personal'' and the ''public/national'' reconstructed in popular culture, film, literature, and (auto)biographical texts dealing with war, genocide, and other forms of political violence? How are wars memorialized and gendered through monuments, museums, and other memory sites? Besides others, case studies on Hungary, Turkey, Germany, Rwanda, former Yugoslavia, and Argentina will be used to elaborate the key concepts and debates in the emerging literature on gender, memory, and war."]}
