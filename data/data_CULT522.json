It asks, how have youth and youth culture been defined and theorized historically? What challenges does the study of youth culture pose in a transnational world? The course also investigates how youth culture (and generational identity) have been studied in Turkey. It  includes a unit in which students undertake a research project of their own on youth culture and/or generational identity in Istanbul."]}
