These connections include people, places, activities, businesses, products, social and integrated business processes happening in personal and business networks or communities. In this course we will study different applications such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and Foursquare, and discover different networks formed by the connectivity. We will introduce tools that will give us insight into how these networks function: We will introduce fundamentals of graph theory and discover how these graphs can be modeled and analyzed (Social Network Analysis). We will also study the interaction dynamics using game theory. Learning objectives are: 1.\tStudy different social applications and how they can be modeled. 2.\tUnderstand the basics of graph theory. 3.\tUnderstand and perform basic social network analysis 4.\tUnderstand the basics of game theory 5.\tApply these concepts to model the Web and new social applications."]}
