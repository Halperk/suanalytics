Social entrepreneurs are using the principles of entrepreneurship to improve the lives of those around them by creating innovative responses to critical social needs (e.g., hunger,poverty, global warming, etc). In other terms, they are change agents. The course aims to enable students to develop an understanding and awareness of the concepts, opportunities and challenges of social entrepreneurship. Students will appreciate the distinctions between private sector, philanthropy and social entrepreneurship. Social innovations will be at the core of the discussion. This is a course for those whose long-term goals extend beyond creating personal economic gain and involve creating broad-scale value for multiple stakeholders."]}
