After Next- generation Sequencing (NGS) technology was established, the cost of DNA sequencing has been decreasing which leads molecular experiments to change their form. These experiments can now be designed to solve DNA-related problems at the genome scale. Consequently, a number of new NGS- based technologies are developed every year. Massively accumulating sequence datasets are often reanalyzed with the aim of answering related but distinct questions from different perspectives. Therefore, it is important to understand not only how these techniques work and but also how their outcomes are in silico analyzed. This course will cover a part of available sequencing techniques such as whole genome sequencing, exome sequencing, RNA-seq, GRO-seq, NET-seq, ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, FAIRE-seq, Hi-C-seq, XR-seq, Damage-seq, etc. The students will learn how to perform these techniques theoretically and how to analyze them practically. The students will be assigned to read and present related articles. Students will also perform an NGS-related project with the skills they will learn during the course flow."]}
