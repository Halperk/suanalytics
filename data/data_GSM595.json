The computer based- simulation will be instrumental for managing a company and its basic functions (production, marketing, financing) in a market of several competitors. The participants, as teams of four to five, will make sequential decisions at the beginning of each period over a certain time horizon and will report, at the end each period, how their decisions affected the performance (measured in terms of market share, profitability and some important finacial ratios) of their company."]}
