The course has three objectives: 1) to provide an overview of the structure and dynamics of global governance in the  late 20th century; 2) to raise issues related to power and justice in the contemporary global order; 3) to analyze the effects of globalization on the nature of order. We will study the relationships between states,international organizations, and non-governmental organizations on issues of international trade, collective security, peace keeping, human rights, development, environment.  Questions that we will address through class readings and discussions will include: what does globalization mean for global governance; is it possible (or even desirable) to have a universal human rights regime; can a trade regime like the WTO actually lead a more just global order?"]}
