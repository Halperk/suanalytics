What modes of political participation are available to citizens in a democratic society? Who should participate in the political process? What forms of political participation are desirable? What is the meaning of political participation to the citizen? Is political participation an end itself or is it an effective means towards achieving other ends? What is the impact of political participation on freedom and equality? Does political participation entail sacrifices from the citizens?
