Within this broad area of focus, it addresses the issue of conceptualising networks and classifying different kinds of network arrangements; the development dynamics of networks; the management of network relationships; and the benefits and costs associated with networks. The aim is to discuss how to explore ways of gaining competitive advantage through network forms of organising."]}
