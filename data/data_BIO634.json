Mechanisms leading to disease and observed molecular changes will be dissected in diseases such as cancer,  Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington?s disease, infectious diseases and some inherited diseases. The lectures will involve discussion of recent advances in the light of  current litterature. Genetic and environmental causes of cancer, cancer types, molecular changes causing cancer, metastasis, treatment of cancer, genetics and molecular mechanisms leading of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, major causes of infectious diseases, viruses, bacteria and parasites, molecular mechanisms of AIDS, hepatitis and common bacterial infections, genetic basis of inherited disease, common genetic diseases and molecular mechanisms will be covered during the course."]}
