Students are expected to do visual research and develop ideas in journals in paper or other appropriate forms and digital media for experimentation and visualization. Exploring potential interrelationships between media, established and new, the projects produced in this course will demonstrate a capacity for independent creative thinking and a consolidation of technical, imaginative, and expressive skills. The course will also place emphasis on the development of a critical and theoretical framework for the evolving practice of digital art."]}
