This semester our focus will again be two-fold.  Through recent documentaries, we will be looking at the current issues and debates  in the world of non-fiction filmmaking, as well  as practical challenges faced by filmmakers.  Throughout the semester, various filmmakers will be invited to present and discuss their  work. On the practice side, each student will have an opportunity to experiment with representation of reality by making a short non-fiction film and presenting it  at various stages in a workshop format."]}
