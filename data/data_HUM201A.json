The course provides students with the tools to analyze different genres, such as the ancient epic, tragedy, comedy, and modern drama; the novel, essay, travel literature, and short stories, including works that refer to the mechanics of writing literature. The course also emphasizes discussion of such thematic concerns as gender and sexuality, Orientalism, and issues related to colonialism and imperialism. Students are taught not only read but also write analytically and critically."]}
