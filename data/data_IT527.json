This course is intended for experienced, professional software developers who work in corporate enterprise development teams and independent software vendors. Most students will be Java or C# developers familiar with introductory XML concepts. In particular the course focuses on how such applications can send, receive, verify, and manipulate XML documents that are exchanged among companies using new technologies such as Web application server, Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Web services, and data binding. The benefits and potential pitfalls of these technologies are covered along with aspects such as using any modern object-oriented language."]}
