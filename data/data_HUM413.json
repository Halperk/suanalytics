The material will be presented on diachronic lines but each strand will be developed separately in its own historical, social and artistic context along with the interaction between ''high art music'' and ''popular music''. Although some mention of the landmark events that had an impact on a given genre will be made to clarify the context, the main focus of the course is listening appreciation. The learning objective is therefore to familiarize the student with the characteristics and features of a given genre and/or style that is in use today. The students are expected to perceive music from a critical standpoint, evaluate artistic content and sort musical data input into the right channels."]}
