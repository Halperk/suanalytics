The euphoria created by the struggles against colonization and racial and class oppression in various parts of the world led artists to reevaluate the political possibilities of literature. The study of a group of writers at the nexus of these struggles incorporates a critical dialogue on cultural studies. Accordingly, the course puts the emphasis on the theoretical debates on how culture, ideology, 'race', ethnicity and class have been defined and/or represented. An important learning outcome is to equip the student with the conceptual tools to analyze a variety of literary texts with respect to politics, ideology and resistance."]}
