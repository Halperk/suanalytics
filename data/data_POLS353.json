To do this, an analytical rather than a descriptive format will be utilized. After briefly dealing with the administrative heritage, the main functions of the state will be linked to the relevant institutions, structures, together with the 'instruments' of implementation. In this context, the legislative, executive and judicial institutions and processes will be analyzed from a functional rather than a formal-legalistic perspective. Then, the principal challenges confronting the state, such as lack of professionalism and meritocracy; bureaucratic politics; reactive rather than proactive policy and decision-making; nepotism, corruption and clientelistic relations, and European Union-related harmonization efforts will be taken up. The course will be concluded with the political/administrative responses to these challenges, the attempts to make a transition from classic public administration to dynamics of governance; civil service capacity enhancement, and public administration reform."]}
