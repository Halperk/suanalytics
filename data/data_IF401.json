The significance of energy in our daily lives is studied along with an insight into the consumption processes and mechanisms while understanding why and how energy is needed. Production of energy is studied with a technological and physical perspective in order to depict how alternative sources of energy are transformed into usable forms of energy. Principles and mechanisms of energy markets are investigated by positioning energy production as a core economic activity. We address how energy production and consumption drives the energy supply chain and decision making processes of parties in the supply chain. The role of energy on global, regional and local policies and their impact on the environment is investigated with an up-to-date perspective."]}
