The topics include Hertzian elastic contact; elastic-plastic behavior under repeated loading; shakedown. Friction theories. Types and measurement of wear. Response of materials to surface tractions. Delamination wear, void/crack nucleation and crack propagation. Elastic Half-space, point, line line and regional loading. Surface roughness effects. Thermal effects in sliding and static contact. Heat partitioning, conduction of heat across interfaces. Flash temperature rise and melt wear. This course course is intended primarily for doctoral students (masters students are also welcome)."]}
