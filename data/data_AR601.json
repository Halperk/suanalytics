There is an international community, with a tradition of dialogue and debate. This core course will include contributions from leading researchers, and an underpinning from the literature. From the start, students will write reflection papers on their own practice, and locate themselves in the various traditions, including: Participatory AR; Socio-Technical Systems Thinking; Scandinavian (Dialogical) AR; Southern (Emancipatory) AR; Collaborative Inquiry; Appreciative Inquiry; Educational AR. For each, the course will consider cases and core literature. Students will interact directly with course faculty, as the Sabanci AR culture develops through the Transformation Project."]}
