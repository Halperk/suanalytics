Conversely, advertising has shaped contemporary cultures and economies. This course will explore the history and place of advertising in today's world, on the one hand, and the place of \"culture\" in advertisements, on the other. Particular emphasis will be placed on representations of social class, gender, sexuality, religion, ethnicity, race, and national identity in advertisements. Case materials will be drawn primarily from contemporary Turkish advertising, with additional examples from other time periods and other countries."]}
