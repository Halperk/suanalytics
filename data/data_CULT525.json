We will seek answers to such questions as: How do transnational media participate in the (re) making of national and local cultures? How do hegemonic media texts intersect with real lives of people in different parts of the world? What kinds of cultural spaces do they create for resistance, subversion and appropriation, and for whom? The organizing framework of the course will be based on three broad headings: a) transnational media and emergent geographies of power and marginality b) media production and cultural production c) mediation of hegemonic meanings and cultural politics."]}
