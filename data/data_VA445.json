Conflicting narratives of the history of the genre have developed in the US and Europe. These genealogies don't merely give an account of the art form-they also both enabled and delimited the work of artists and the ways that spectators view them. By examining and critiquing the dominant narratives of the history of performance art, I hope to offer alternative ways of understanding the significance(s) of the genre. I will take into account works that have been crucial to the field, attending to the multiple layers, voices and practices that lay within it."]}
