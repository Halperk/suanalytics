We will review the unique characteristics of industries characterized by frequent innovation, and explore how strategies in these industries are (or are not) different from other contexts. We will also focus on the process of managing innovation, both internally and externally. This course is suited for students aspiring to become entrepreneurs, general managers or consultants to general managers who are faced with situations in which innovation in new products, services and technologies is important, or those who would like to build basic background on the topic of strategy and innovation."]}
