The theoretical and practical aspects for modelling, simulation and NC Programming techniques will be discussed. The topics covered during the lectures will be applied through homework, lab sessions and a course project. Techniques for analytical surfaces representation and modeling, surface generation techniques in CAD environment, theoretical aspects of toolpath computation for 3 and 5 axis milling, machining strategies offered by commercial CAM packages, theoretical and practical aspects of post processing issues for 3 and 5 axis milling will be covered. Process modeling for simulation and verification of 3 and 5 axis milling processes will be covered. Machining systems such as CNC machines, robotic manufacturing systems will be focused."]}
