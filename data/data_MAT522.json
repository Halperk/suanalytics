Systems that form glasses are investigated, and their phase equilibria will be studied. Phase seperation and spinodal decomposition in different systems can lead to innovative processing techniques for high temperature materials. Thus a solid knowledge of glass formation is essential for materials engineer and will be made available in this course. Atomic mobility and deformation in glasses will be treated in ceramics to gain insight into their mechanical, chemical and electrical properties. The course will also focus on optical properties of various glasses."]}
