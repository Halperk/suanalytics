We will examine topics such as VDJ recombination in T and B lymphocytes, immunoglobulin class switching, and somatic hypermutation. Students will gain an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cellular and developmental events that make up the mammalian immune system. Similarities between the mammalian immune system the innate immune system of plants and the olfactory system of higher eukaryotes will be discussed."]}
