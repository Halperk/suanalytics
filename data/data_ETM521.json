From AC-DC wars to first transmission lines and early metering systems, the power system we use today has been deeply molded by the historical developments and technological “path dependence”. More complicated engineering concepts for power system operation will be discussed with case studies based on US and European blackouts. The technologies and their capabilities are the enablers and bottlenecks for the power system operation we have today. The course will be based on case studies to smoothen the understanding of the engineering concepts."]}
