Different than classical plant pathology courses, this course studies plant-pathogen interaction, starting from the resistance gene induced signal transduction pathways to the molecular diagnosis of plant diseases. The course is divided into five subtopics; Pathogen ingression and invasive mechanisms; Host cell recognition and response- resistance and susceptibility, Regulation of resistance genes and signal transduction; Pathogen mechanisms against host defenses, enzymes, toxins, and other pathogenic factors; Exploitation of molecular plant pathology in the biotechnological control of disease.", "Symptoms and diagnosis of viral, bacterial and fungal diseases; disease management strategies; physiology and genetics of host-pathogen interactions; resistance mechanisms and gene expression during host-pathogen interaction; application of genetic engineering in plant pathology."]}
