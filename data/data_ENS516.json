Staring with Scanning Tunnelling Microscope we will elaborate most of the common SPM methods. However, we shall spend most of the time on Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Half of the course will involve hands-on practical work at the AFM Lab at SUNUM. Students will finish the course with detailed analysis of their own specimen using AFM."]}
