Different aspects of law, such as court practice, legal interpretation, and royal legislation, are examined, and the relevant primary sources introduced, in alternating years. (Thus if the theme for a particular semester has been the practice of ifta, after an introduction to relevant debates in the field of Islamic and Ottoman law, the class embarks on a collective historical survey of selected themes as they appear in fetva collections of the 16th to  the 18th centuries. A comparable approach will be adopted for other themes to be offered in rotation over the years.) Requirements : a major research paper of around 30 pages based on primary source materials. Counts towards fulfilling the seminar requirement in History. Prerequisite : An adequate command of Ottoman Turkish, through TLL 501-502 or the equivalent, and subject to the instructor's approval."]}
