Often referred to as the ''third sector,\" it is composed of charitable or public benefit, advocacy and mutual benefit organizations. Our primary focus will be on the public serving or benefit organizations in the education, arts, health, human services, and the environment. These are organizations which account for the most of third sector employment in Turkey. Continued resource scarcity, devolution of responsibilities by government, and privatization have put additional pressure on the nonprofit sector to fill in where government withdraws and to work in partnership with other organizations in the delivery of public services. This is a course for students interested doing community service during one semester and in better understanding nonprofit organizations especially that rely heavily on volunteers. Students who take this course are expected to volunteer in a service providing setting throughout the semester at least 2 hours a week. Class hours may be devoted to that if needed. Through this experience, student will learn about the operations of one organization from the ground up while providing service to his/her community. Several local nonprofit organization managers or consultants will join us to discuss issues and topics of mutual concern.
