This class aims to critically examine the cultural assumptions embedded in existing organizational theories,  which typically have emerged from the US.  Secondly, and in line with the first aim, it tries to sensitize  students to the issue of contextual diversity in which organizations and their members operate as well as creating some awareness about perspectives that have something to say about societal variation. To this end, conceptualizations of culture, theoretical perspectives linking culture to behavior, methodological issues in conducting cross-cultural research, as well as the research on cross-cultural differences will be covered. Specific focus will be on understanding how culture affects basic psychological processes, including cognition, emotion, and motivation and their implications in terms  of micro organizational studies."]}
