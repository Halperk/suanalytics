Limitations and advantages of monolithic components to the RF circuit designers are described through a series of case studies using typical RF IC transceiver circuits. Topics include:  RF and Microwave semiconductor technologies (silicon, SiGe, etc.) and devices (CMOS, HBT, HEMT, BiCMOS, etc.), monolithic amplifiers (broadband and low-noise), translinear circuits (up and downconversion mixers, frequency multipliers/ dividers, etc.), phase-locked synthesizers, output  stages, active / passive frequency selective circuits/filters and their components, including MicroElectroMechanical passives for filters. Transmitter, receiver, and power amplifier architectures are described with a focus on the monolithic context."]}
