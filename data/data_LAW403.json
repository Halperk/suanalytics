After a quick overview of civil law, common law, transnational and international legal regimes, it includes tort law, sales and contract law, transport, and multi-national corporations and limited companies.  Some of the problems which globalization makes more critical, such as foreign investment, labour and employment, intellectual property, and corporate social responsibility and environmental issues, are raised.  While ''real world' cases and materials are used extensively as examples, the course also seeks to bring out the underlying assumptions and policies of these institutions and rules."]}
