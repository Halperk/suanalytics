The course will be mainly demonstrations and laboratory exercises supplemented with lectures. Lecture topic areas cover molecular composition of cells, effects of media and physical parameters on growth, and metabolism. It also deals with regulation of gene expression as well as stress responses of cells, maintenance of energy and cell survival. The laboratory sessions will be conducted much as the students were working in a research laboratory therefore students will gain hands on experience in cellular and molecular biology techniques."]}
