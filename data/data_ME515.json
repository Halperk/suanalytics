Emphasis is on the numerical solution methods of partial differential equations and their use in computational analysis and simulations for engineering design. There will be a number of case studies and examples to enhance the lectures with examples. Topics covered are: basic numerical methods for root-finding, solution of linear system of equations and ordinary-differential equations, finite-difference solution of parabolic, elliptic and hyperbolic partial-differential equations and finite-element solution of elliptic PDEs such as Poisson equation in 1D."]}
