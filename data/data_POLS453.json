The course will also try to develop alternative solution models to the observed and identified problems of the Country. In this regard, three main components of the State i.e., the legislature, the executive and the judiciary will be analysed in great detail including the administration of the national economy. Core issues of democratisation (such as election system, political parties, Southeastern Turkey) problem will also be analysed thoroughly basing upon actual case studies."]}
