The general term immigration is often used to talk about political exiles, economic refugees and internal migrants, as well as those who fit the classic picture of an individual or family moving permanently to a new home country. This course will look at literary works by writers who have been classified as \"immigrants\" to the country from which they write. While the course will take into account the linguistic, political and cultural issues these authors consider, it will also consider how the writers themselves have embraced or rejected the designation of \"immigrant\" and what is at stake in such a decision."]}
