If and when can the conflicts be reconciled? Conflict transformation, peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction entail a variety of components, including creating institutions that will foster lasting peace and stability, designing and implementing mechanisms for bringing accountability to perpetrators of war crimes and human rights abuses, and fostering reconciliation in post-conflict societies. This course will explore the complex legal, political, and moral considerations that shape efforts to promote peacebuilding. We will look at various methods developed over the last half-century to reconstruct societies divided by war, political repression or ethnic conflict."]}
