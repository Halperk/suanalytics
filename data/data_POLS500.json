It begins with the Greek classiscs and covers the medieval thinkers and ends with Renaissance and the 16th century thinkers. Given more than two millennia between the first and the last, the course aims to place each thinker within the relevant historical context linking each with the past and present day discussions thus preparing the students for a sound evaluation of later stages of political theorizing."]}
