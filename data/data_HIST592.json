Special focus on the Republican People's Party as a political organisation, and on the changing features of the one-party system, together with explorations of political, economic and cultural life. Aspects of Turkish foreign policy under İnönü. Frameworks of synchronic comparison with other one-party régimes, as well as of diachronic comparisons between the early and late phases of one-party rule in Turkey."]}
