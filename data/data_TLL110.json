TLL 110 provides rigorous familiarization with the technical aspects of the Ottoman script in conjunction with a comprehensive review of the grammatical characteristics of Ottoman Turkish. The sequence as a whole is more intensive than the standard Beginning Ottoman course, and aims to enable students to take thematically focused advanced paleography courses from their second year onward.", "This course aims to introduce basic reading & writing principles of Ottoman Turkish. Mainly, students will be taught how to read and write Ottoman letters & scripts before starting to work on basic printed texts. The main principles of Medieval/Ottoman Turkish grammar and their usage in Ottoman Turkish will also be introduced. Another important aspect of this course is to inform the students with the use of dictionaries to solve problems encountered in the assigned texts, and widening their perspectives on the variety of Ottoman texts and Ottoman book culture. There will be weekly reading & writing assessments and in-class exercises."]}
