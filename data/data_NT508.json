Different chemical processes for the synthesis of various nanomaterials including inorganic nanoparticles, metal-oxide nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials, nano-porous materials, bio-inspired nanomaterials, polymeric nanomaterials and quantum dots will be covered in detail. In addition, various chemical and fabrication methods to obtain nanostructured or nano-scale coatings such as layer-by-layer, Langmuir–Blodgett and various deposition techniques such as chemical vapor, physical vapor and atomic layer deposition will be covered. Finally, students will gain hands-on-experience on the synthesis and characterization of selected nanoparticles in the laboratory."]}
