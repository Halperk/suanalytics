By the end of the course a solid understanding of the principles of bilateral control in the context of modern classical control and hands-on experience with implementation of bilateral controllers on force-feedback devices are aimed. Covered topics include haptic rendering of virtual environments, passivity of the human- in-the-loop systems, transparency and coupled stability scaled teleoperation architectures, trade-off between robust stability and transparency, destabilizing effects of communication/computation delays and approaches to compensate for these time delays, namely, time domain passivity and wave variable approaches. The course is appropriate for students in any engineering discipline with interests in robotics, nonlinear controls, and haptics"]}
