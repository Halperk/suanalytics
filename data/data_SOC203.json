Works from a variety of disciplinary traditions such as Anthropology, Sociology, History, Political Science, Economics, Philosophy and Literature shall be read. Some of the main themes that Law and Society scholarship has tackled over the last three decades: origins and different sorts of law and lawmaking, the relationship of law to the political domain, the relationship of law to socio-economic structures of hierarchy and the relation between law on the books and law in action will be explored."]}
