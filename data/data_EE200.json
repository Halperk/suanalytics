In the second module, DC, small-signal and frequency models of semiconductor devices such as PN diodes, BJT and MOSFETs will be included. Using these models, different circuit implementation will be executed, such as Wave Shaping Circuits (with diodes, op-amps, passives and integral/differentiator circuits), Different Configuration of Single/Multi Stage Amplifiers (CE, CC, DB, and combination of these as multistage amp., CS, CD, CG, and combinations), Oscillators (with BJTs and feedback concepts), etc. Analytical design methodologies, along with CAD tools (such as PSPICE), will also be part of the course for designing and implementing circuits."]}
