Financial engineering in the US can determine employment and growth in Bursa and other parts of the world; CO2 emissions from China affect crop yields in Konya, and beyond; an epidemic in Vietnam or a nuclear leak in Japan determine the state of global public health. What is less clear is what sort of responsibilities we have towards each other. Without at least a draft of a global social contract, it would be impossible for us to navigate our global interdependence. This course reviews the current state of the world, analyzes the centripetal forces which push us together, and discusses what responsibilities we all have towards others. Various arguments for normative and technocratic frameworks will also be reviewed."]}
