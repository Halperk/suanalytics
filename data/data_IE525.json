Among others, probabilistic and statistical methods, possibilistic methods, clustering algorithms, decision trees, metaheuristics (such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc.) and mathematical programming will be covered as part of the toolbox that are widely utilized in data mining.  Particular emphasis will be given to multi criteria decision making and multi objective optimization, and their usage in data mining.The course will include case studies from both manufacturing and service industries."]}
