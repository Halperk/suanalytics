Against this background, the course will then focus on the foreign policy of both Greece and Turkey; major bilateral issues between the two countries, the effect of Cyprus and the influence of the European Union on the bilateral relations; the new geopolitical environment of the two countries in which the recent d√©tente took rise; and policy alternatives for the near future."]}
