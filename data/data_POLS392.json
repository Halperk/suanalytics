Contrasting political alignments had already emerged in the course of the War of Independence; their extensions and ramifications are pursued through the phase immediately preceding the creation of the Republic, down to the end of the Kemalist-dominated early Republican era. The political, cultural, economic and foreign policy dimensions of this entire period are viewed as a whole, though with specific emphasis on its political organizations. The experience of 20th century dictatorships like Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, or Spain under Franco are drawn upon in constructing a broad comparative framework."]}
