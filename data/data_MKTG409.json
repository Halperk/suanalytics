Factors related to both the supply side (e.g., cost structure) and the consumer side (e.g., perceived value, willingness to pay) should be considered in setting prices. The first part of the course provides an overview of how both types of factors effect pricing decisions. Unlike economic and financial approaches to pricing, a greater emphasis is given to behavioral drivers and understanding the demand side. The course coverage includes value pricing, price customization, price bundling, price presentation strategies, and sales promotions. Course evaluation includes participation in class discussions, project presentation, and written exam."]}
