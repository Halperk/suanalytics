The approach involves discussion, dissection and imitation. Each lecture will begin with the discussion of submitted texts by class members. The second part will involve the close scrutiny of a published text, paying special attention to matters of style and structure, word choice, mannerism, dialogue, social context, theory, autobiography, intertextuality; hence, dissection. Each week's assignment will be to produce an \"imitation\" of the text studied. These texts will be chosen to illustrate a variety of approaches to writing, and to raise some of the basic questions of writing."]}
