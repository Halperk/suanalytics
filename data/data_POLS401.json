It starts with a comparative assessment of the kind of questions survey research is most able to answer and sources of error associated with this methodology. It next clarifies different stages of survey planning and moves on to discuss questionnaire design issues. Next, the discussion focuses on sampling techniques, survey data analysis and reporting. All discussions are illustrated within the framework of a small project that is carried out by course participants."]}
