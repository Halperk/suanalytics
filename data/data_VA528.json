This course will introduce students to some of the major shifts in the modes of understanding and evaluation of art, considering these in both their philosophical and cultural significances. Students will be encouraged to develop their critical vocabularies, moving across a range of different works and critical procedures, as well as to reflect on the aims and purposes of art and the criticism of art."]}
