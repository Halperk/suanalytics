The proper functioning these systems is dependent on networks of reactions involving macromolecules. This course focuses on physical principles governing behavior of biological macromolecules and their interactions, and investigates how concepts developed at macromolecular level can be applied to studies at systems level. Topics can be grouped under two main headings; introduction to molecular biophysics and understanding specific process of living systems through application of molecular biophysics principles. Topics of the introduction are molecular forces involved in the formation and interactions of acromolecules, reaction kinetics, molecular transport processes and energy generation and maintenance. Principles developed at molecular level will be used to analyze mechanisms two specific processes: movement and vision."]}
