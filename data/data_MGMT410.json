The course puts the policy and strategic choice issues in a social context and adresses the economic and social impact of management choices  by establishing the link between the business decisions  and their economic and social performance implications. The emphasis of the course is on strategy - market strategy,  and its integration with the non-market strategy of the firm. The course covers the fundamantal  concepts of market based strategy formulation such as `core and distinctive competencies', `sources of competitive advantage', `growth strategies', `diversification and outsourcing', while linking them to performance outcomes  from both shareholder and stakeholder value perspectives. It uses Corporate Governance and the notion of `Corporate Social Responsibility' as the conceptual framework of inquiry."]}
