The students learn’ the theories of learning; from habituation, classical conditioning, and instrumental conditioning to stimulus control, aversive control, and their applications to the study of cognition. The course also covers how findings from animal research relate to human learning and behavior, and touches base with the main concepts in neurophysiology offering insights into neural substrates of learning processes."]}
