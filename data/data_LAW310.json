In addition to increasing familiarity with fundamental concepts of different legal traditions in certain specific fields of law, the totality of the discussion topics covered will let the students take some initial steps toward discovering the formation process and the underlying logic of legal thought. While the course will also aim at conveying a certain amount of abstract legal information in fields such as constitutional law, contract law, human rights, business organisations' law, criminal law, intellectual property law and such, the main purpose of the course will be to therefore collectively discover the relationship between law and logic, tradition, justice, power and ideology."]}
