It is based upon an integrated approach to the formulation, analysis and implementation of corporate level strategies in the spectrum ranging from creating core competence, design and process quality, process re-engineering, transformation and overall renewal. Alternative approaches to manufacturing systems such as flexible, just-in-time and cellular manufacturing, and CAD/CAM will be analysed."]}
