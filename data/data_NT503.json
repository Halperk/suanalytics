In this module, we will explore the applications of nanotechnologies in various industrial sectors, merging the needs for innovation at each sector and the enabling aspect of nanotechnologies afforded by the control and measurement afforded at atomic levels. The sectors to be reviewed are: health and biomedical science, energy, environment and water, electronic, aerospace, defense, automotive, food and beverages including agriculture, construction and structural materials, cosmetics, and textiles and sports. We will use examples of successful and unsuccessful products and the transition from research and development to commercialization.   We will also explore the impact of nanotechnologies on the consumer and the society."]}
