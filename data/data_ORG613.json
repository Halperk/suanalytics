It aims to develop a critical appreciation of the historical evolution and the current state of management and organisation studies. The former part of the course is devoted to charting the domain and concerns of organisational analysis and deals with issues like organisations and their environments, goals and effectiveness, power and control, their and work, and forms and structuring of organisations. The course then proceeds to a review and discussion of major perspectives and research programmes in organisational analysis. The student is thus given an opportunity to develop an understanding of the central features of different perspectives as well as appreciating the nature of ongoing controversy and debate among competing viewpoints. The review of earlier traditions like scientific management, human relations and contingency theory are followed by critical perspectives of the time, namely Marxist and action frames of reference. More recent research traditions to be reviewed include resource dependence, institutionalist, and ecological perspectives as well as those that stem from neo-isntitutionalist economics and economic sociology. The course finally considers more recent alternative traditions like interpretive, critical realist, and postmodern approaches."]}
