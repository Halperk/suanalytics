Within this broad area of focus, it addresses, first, the issue of conceptualizing networks and classifying different kinds of network arrangements that can be empirically identified. Secondly, by drawing upon a variety of theoretical streams, it explores the conditions and processes that motivate and facilitate the formation of different kinds of networks. Thirdly, it focuses on the development dynamics and the management of network relationships with suppliers, customers, competitors, dealers and intermediary organisations. Finally, it discusses the benefits and costs associated with networks with a view to exploring ways of gaining competitive advantage through network forms of organising."]}
