In particular, it marks the twilight of empires. This course will take a close look at both the general and the Ottoman-Turkish experience of 1914-18. Aspects covered will include : the New Imperialism background; the road to war; the unfolding of military action, and the various fronts and campaigns, in Europe and elsewhere; the new war economies; the carnage at the front and various other forms of human suffering behind the lines; dimensions of ethnic cleansing; ; the impact on art and literature; social and political consequences."]}
