This course will introduce students to urban anthropology and trace the development of the field, focusing in particular on current theoretical and methodological concerns in ethnographic studies of the global city. While the course will provide a comparative perspective on global cities, students will have the opportunity to undertake a fieldwork project of their own in the city of Istanbul."]}
