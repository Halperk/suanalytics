Viewed from this perspective football is not only a sport but it is also a social phenomenon. Football is deeply embedded in and relates to concepts like patriotism, nations, nationality, nationalism and the state. This course primarily aims to study football as a social phenomenon and to explore its political, social and cultural implications on a global scale. Football, as a political instrument whether employed for repression of the masses or as a way of expressing different identities is an exceptional game that carries the potential to help us to understand the complexities of modern society and politics."]}
