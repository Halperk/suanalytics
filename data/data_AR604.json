We construct an interdisciplinary framework, drawing from social theory, organization theory, political theory, political economy, and moral philosophy. Our primary objective is to learn the paradigms of structure and agency. We focus on functionalist, interactionist, conflict, and critical theory, and explore how we may use each of these paradigms in particular case studies. We consider power, and how it influences transformation processes, as both a constraint and facilitator. We problematize and differentiate macro and micro contexts. We study contemporary global and local issues that business executives and other organizational leaders, as change agents, face in their professional contexts and everyday life. We examine managing disruptions in international trade and international finance; interstate conflicts regarding global governance; social, economic and political concerns about governmental policies on problems such as unemployment, social and gender inequality, environmental sustainability, climate change, and rapid and never-ending technological change towards robotics and Artificial Intelligence; and growing social demand for corporate social responsibility and ethical conduct from business executives. Students are required to work on a live transformation process, through teaming up with local organizations or joining in an ongoing project in their organizations."]}
