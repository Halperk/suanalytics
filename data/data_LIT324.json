Questions of identity are frequently at the heart of good literature, and the group of works which has been classified as \"postcolonial\" is no exception.  As we read a selection of works from the colonial and postcolonial worlds, we will explore the writers' and our own answers to key questions of identity.  What does it mean to \"belong\" to a culture, nation, ethnicity, community or family?  What kinds of identity are possible in contexts where a colonizing power has undermined traditional affiliations?  We will read short stories and novels, as well as works of theory relevant to the other course readings."]}
