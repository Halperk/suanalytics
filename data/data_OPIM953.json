This simulation course focuses on effective modeling and analysis of complicated processes through the use of computer simulation techniques.  The course emphasizes modeling and covers examples from many potential simulation applications in the real world, including manufacturing systems analysis, service systems analysis (such as hospitals, restaurants), financial analysis, and quality improvement programs."]}
