It focuses on: basic camera techniques such as exposure, white balance, ISO, shutter speed and depth-of-field; the appropriate use of lighting like key lights, side lights, hair lights, natural/outdoor lighting and the use of diffusers and reflectors; and lastly, an emphasis will be placed on the combined use of both in-camera and lighting techniques for achieving specific photographic effects. Additionally, the course introduces digital imaging processes like color correction, sharpness, burning and dodging, and the preparation of images for the web and print."]}
