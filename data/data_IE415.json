A typical DSS includes a database, a model base, a knowledge base and a graphical user interface (GUI). The course includes a brief introduction of database management systems (relational databases, SQL), optimization techniques, spreadsheet based optimization, and review of relevant AI techniques that would be crucial to develop the model base; knowledge acquisition and knowledge representation, probabilistic and approximate reasoning as the basis of the knowledge base and GUI development. The course will also include the discussion of DSSs for a number of application domains, chosen to illustrate principles of system development, such as the health care applications, portfolio optimization, production and distribution systems, and information systems for top management. The learning outcome of the course is to learn how to couple the IT tools with the optimization tools in real world problems, particularly in manufacturing and service systems."]}
