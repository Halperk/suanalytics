While exploring the major role role that negotiation dynamics play in their personal and professional lives, participants will improve their own negotiation skills, allowing them to act consciously and skillfully in tough situations. Participants will also learn to recognize negotiation situations in everyday life and to use them as training-grounds to continue to improve their skills. The learning format includes interactive lectures and role-playing exercises, both in class and online, in which participants will experience negotiations - not as onlookers, but as active parties."]}
