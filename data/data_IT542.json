The course will also show the students the limitations of traditional programming techniques and how Hadoop addresses these problems. After learning the basics of a Hadoop Cluster and Hadoop Ecosystem, students will learn to write programs using Apache Spark framework and run these programs on a Hadoop Cluster."]}
