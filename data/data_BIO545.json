Plant cells and cytodifferentiation; biosynthesis and mechanisms of action of  phytohormones in particular auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, absicic acid and ethylene; signal perception and transduction; secondary messangers; organogenesis; embryogenesis; seed development, dormancy and germination; flower development; photomorphogenesis will be covered in detail"]}
