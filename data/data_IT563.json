Rather than plan, instruct and direct, the agile project manager facilitates, coaches and serves. In the Scrum Agile practice this person is called a ScrumMaster- Agile project manager. In this course participants learn what an agile software project is, how to manage project risks and issues, and how to guide the development team and an organization into Agile practice by fostering the adoption of new attitudes, collaborative processes and working to remove institutional barriers. Exercises, case studies, and examples are used to assist participants to develop the knowledge, skills, capabilities."]}
