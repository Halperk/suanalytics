Recent advances in technology have accelerated brain research, and have given the opportunity to experiment and question the theoretical frameworks related to decision making developed in various disciplines. In this regard, decision making has become of particular interest to scientific fields such as cognitive and behavioral neuroscience, cognitive psychology, computational sociology and neuroeconomics. In this course, the students will learn how to model realistically and consistently the basic elements of decision making, i.e., the value system and objectives , alternatives, uncertainties, and preferences, based on the mathematical frameworks provided by various fields such as economics, operations research, computer sciences, as well as cognitive, physiological, and behavioral neuroscience. In the course, some mathematical tools, techniques and approaches (e.g., decision trees, game theory, mathematical programming, modeling uncertainty and Bayes theorem, Bayesian learning, modeling of preferences and vNM utility theory, entropy, decision tree learning and artificial neural networks) which will provide an analytical framework for decision making an learning will be covered. Aside to these techniques findings from the recently growing fields such as neuroeconomics, behavioral economics and behavioral neuroscience (e.g., prospect theory, conditioning, reinforcement, reward and punishment, expectation of judgment and decision- making, experience and deferral) will also be discussed within the same framework. In the course neural processes and mechanisms of social and individual decision making, behavior and choice (e.g., reward perception, learning types, attention, memory, belief systems, interaction with motor processes, trust, cooperation, alturism, social behavior) will be addressed and supported by neuroethological comparisons."]}
