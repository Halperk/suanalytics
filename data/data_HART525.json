This course aims to provide students with knowledge on a given art history/ history topic based on a closer study of \"the real works\" displayed at the exhibition but also based on the design and implementation of museum practice-oriented projects that will be integrated in the museum educational activities. The topic of this course will change each time it is offered since it depends on the opportunities provided by ongoing exhibitions in Ä°stanbul"]}
