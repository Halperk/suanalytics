When system modeling, design and fabrication processes are being performed, scaling and interaction of different scales become prominent. This course covers the fundamental properties of scales, design theories, modeling methods and manufacturing issues with different applications. Examples of engineering systems include micro -/macro-robotics, micro-/macro-actuators, MEMS, microfluidics, micromanipulators (AFM, microinjection technologies), robotic surgery (da Vinci robots), biosensors, MRI machines, and solar energy panels. Students will master the materials through problem sets, scientific discussions with experts from industry or medicine, and will improve their project presentation skills."]}
