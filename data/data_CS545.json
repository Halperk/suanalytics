It is intended to provide insight and experience into issue within work and consumer settings that influence the design of computer interfaces. Students will develop skills in observing and working with people in interdisciplinary design groups, identifying constraints and trade-offs on designs within the context of use, and using models of work and other activity as guides to interface design."]}
