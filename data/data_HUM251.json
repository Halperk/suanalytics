While we will analyze the literary properties of the works, we will also pay close attention to how these texts expose the social underpinnings of duty, honor and gender roles, and how they comment on the cultural landscapes in which they were written. In addition, we will be assessing how and why they are relevant today. In addition to the existing pre-requisite \" to have completed 23 credits\" for this course , a new condition will be added as \"to complete SPS 101 and SPS 102 courses at least with D grade\" as of the Fall semester of 2015-2016 Academic Year. Students who failed from SPS 101 and SPS 102 courses, do not have right to take this course."]}
