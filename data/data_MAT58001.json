This course provides cutting- edge knowledge on both theoretical and applied aspects of nanomaterial design, formulation, application, and management on sustainable agriculture and food supply. The course will focuses on nanomaterials and nanotechnological developments on physical or chemical  soil enhancements, controlled delivery and release of fertilizer, sustained release plant protection agents to combat pests (herbicides, insecticides and fungicides) which directly affect the wellbeing of agricultural crops. Moreover, the effect of nanotechnology on post-harvest protection and packaging applications for sustainable agriculture and food supply chain will be covered."]}
