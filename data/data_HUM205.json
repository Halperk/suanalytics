Given the very wide scope, genres and product of the cinema the course will be structured on a thematic base (history, thrillers, documentaries, politics, literature, interculturality)  however will have a chronological base as well. Th films, the most crucial component of the course, will not only be analysed from a technical, cinematographic angle but will be situated and discussed through its interaction with the cultural background. The mythological, semiological and intertextual peculiarities of cinema both as a cultural and technical fact will also be exposed to the students. In addition to the existing pre-requisite \" to have completed 23 credits\" for this course , a new condition will be added as \"to complete SPS 101 and SPS 102 courses at least with D grade\" as of the Fall semester of 2015-2016 Academic Year. Students who failed from SPS 101 and SPS 102 courses, do not have right to take this course."]}
