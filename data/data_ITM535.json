Topics include use of IS and IT resources to support Excel-based decision-making, use of Excel to develop and solve mathematical models for most common management problems, basic linear and non-linear programming and queuing model building concepts, sensitivity analysis and its implications on decision-making.", "This course aims to enhance participants' understanding of practical management problems in such areas as operations, finance, and marketing, and provide a managerial perspective in solving them. Quantitative models are introduced and solved in Excel environment, using the optimization tools available. The main focus is on recognizing how optimization problems arise in different settings, how managers should go about formulating and solving them, and how decision support systems should be employed in conjunction with problem solving."]}
