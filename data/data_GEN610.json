It offers a theoretical survey of the role of gender in shaping definitions of the political and practices of citizenship and participation. Through the discussion of concrete examples representing a diversity of cultural, social and political contexts, the course opens up to discussion gendered social and political mobilizations, identity politics, the interaction between the personal and the political, and different forms and spheres of doing politics ranging from the everyday to transnational, face- to-face to digital encounters. The course also critically assesses the sociopolitical ramifications of institutional and national gender policies and cultural political perspectives regarding changing gender relations."]}
