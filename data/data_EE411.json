RF integrated circuit design fundamental/parameters will be reviewed, S-parameters, nonlinearity, sensitivity, efficiency, noise figure, input, output dynamic ranges, matching, etc., and implemented, along with circuit design fundamentals, at different circuits, such as Low Noise Amplifiers, Mixers, Oscillators, Frequency Synthesizers, and Power Amplifiers, Phase Shifters, Attenuators, etc. Recitation/Lab implementations will be carried out by designing such circuits using CAD tools, such as Cadence, ADS, Momentum, Sonnet, and also will include testing practices of such circuits."]}
