The second course is MGMT 505 Data Analysis Using Excel. This course provides a detailed introduction to descriptive statistics and basic overview of probability theory (with specific focus on its application in decision trees).  Applications are chosen from functional areas of management to lay the foundation for more detailed study in others courses of the curriculum. The emphasis is both on conceptual understanding of the material and doing hands on statistical analysis. Microsoft Excel and associated add-ins are used for the purpose of analysis."]}
