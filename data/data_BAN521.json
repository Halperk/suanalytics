With case analyses, assignments, and classroom discussions, students will learn the assumptions, limitations and the effective use of the analytical methods such as optimization, Monte Carlo simulation, discrete-event simulation and decision trees. The focus will be on model formulation and interpretation of results, not on mathematical theory. This course is designed for program students with an interest in formal decision modeling. Therefore, the emphasis is on models that are widely used in diverse industries regardless of the functional areas."]}
