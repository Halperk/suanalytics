My objective in this course is to present a systematic application of strategic marketing in the global environment. I present an integrated treatment of conceptual and managerial issues in contemporary international marketing based on the state-of-the-art research in the field. The focus is on the formulation of comprehensive marketing strategies by multinationals from developed economies, such as the United States, but also from emerging economies, such as India, China, S. Africa, and Turkey, competing in global industries. The course is designed to provide an appreciation for cross-functional and interdisciplinary perspectives in international business. This is because todayâ€™s global operations increasingly require these proficiencies in managing core business processes."]}
