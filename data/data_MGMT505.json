The first course is MGMT 504 Decisions and Uncertainty.  This course provides a detailed introduction to inferential statistics (confidence intervals and hypothesis testing), analysis of variance and linear regression modeling. Applications are chosen from functional areas of management to lay the foundation for more detailed study in others courses of the curriculum. The emphasis is both on conceptual understanding of the material and doing hands on statistical analysis. Microsoft Excel and associated add-ins are used for the purpose of analysis."]}
