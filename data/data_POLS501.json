While the conventional literature on ideology, discourse, Orientalism, liberalism, democracy, and fascism will be covered on the one hand, approaches that go beyond nation-state paradigms in social sciences will be introduced, on the other. The latter will include a survey of the reconceptualization of citizenship as a result of the processes prompted by globalization. The critical issues concerning the dynamics and motor of political change will also be studied. (A required course for Political Science PhD students)"]}
