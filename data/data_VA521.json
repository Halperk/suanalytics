The mechanisation of production associated with industrialisation has occasioned major shifts in the practices and discourses of visual art. Technological innovations have perhaps radically altered relations to the visible. Debates about the values of craft in art have been crucial in defining modern art and design education. This course, in continuation of VA 520, will review the contemporary significance of these issues in the practice and theory of art and design."]}
