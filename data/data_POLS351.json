The interaction between state and society and the theories that analyze political change will be studied thoroughly within the framework of the course.  A theoretical structure will be drawn in order to understand the formation of diverse political structures and the dynamics of political change in several countries.  There will also be specific references to the dynamics of political change in different geographica areas of the world, such as Europe, Asia and the Middle East"]}
