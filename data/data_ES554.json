This course explores the changing face, dilemmas and opportunities of migration in both receiving and sending states, emphasizing the political aspects of migration. The geographical and temporal focus may vary according to the instructor. The course examines why people move, the politics and policies of border control in the developed receiving states (e.g., USA, Canada, Western Europe) and how domestic and/or interstate developments such as European integration have changed the nature of migration policymaking. It addresses questions of immigrant integration and diversity and studies the benefits and challenges to receiving states. Special topics include emigration and development, remittances, brain drain, the role of sending state policies on state and identity formation and an analysis of the Turkish case as an example of a state facing the challenges of both emigration and immigration."]}
