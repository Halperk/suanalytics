The students, who examined the Brand Management with its key principles, will choose one of three different sectors and study the macro economy that affects the brand management. The purpose of the course is to discuss the special dynamics of the sectors, markets of the brands in retail, fast-consuming and pharmaceutical sectors. The course will be prepared based on actors, competition and regulation and conducted in three different sections/sectors.  For the sectors with less than 6 student applications, no course will be opened and those students will study in one of the opened sectors.", "B2C - B2B Marketing course elaborates critical topics in the journey of a brand. Approaches to the end users vary hugely in the fields of B2B and B2C, and our course reflects upon that. The instructors, expertise and real life practices are the core of the course.  B2B part will be designed in a “blended” manner."]}
