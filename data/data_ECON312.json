The course also involves some instructive quick experiments to illustrate how individuals' behavior deviates from the standard model. These experiments make students effortlessly identify the systematic deviations from the standard theory and understand the limitations of the existing models. Behavioral models that use insights from psychology are introduced to explain the puzzle and applied to illustrate new insights and predictions with a debate about the weaknesses of behavioral models."]}
