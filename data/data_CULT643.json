This course explores the gendered aspects of  wars, militarism, and peace politics. The first part of the course War, Militarism and Gender, focuses on the ways in which wars, militaries and military service have shaped gendered self - understandings in the 20th century. The second part, Women and Peace, is based on a historical survey of women's peace activism in different parts of the world. The third section, Feminism and Peace Politics, highlights feminist theorizing on peace and peace politics. The course will be organized as a seminar. The active participation of students in class discussions and presentations will be essential. Students are expected to carry out original research towards the final paper. Subject to these conditions, CULT 643 may be counted towards the fulfillment of the seminar requirements for the History MA and PhD programs.
