In order to make intelligent decisions, one must have access to data and information. The main issue is thus, how does one approach large quantities of data with the purpose of intelligent decision- making? The purpose of this course is to introduce the concepts, techniques, tools, and applications of data mining, using a commercially available data-mining software. The material is approached from the perspective of a business analyst, with an emphasis on supporting tactical and strategic decisions. Students should expect to get hands dirty with real data and analysis software, to perform some common data-mining tasks and earn skill as a business analyst."]}
