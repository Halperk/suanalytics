In particular we use a supply chain scenario to study how human beings make individual and strategic decisions in the face of uncertainty and risk. First, we use the standard newsvendor problem to discuss decisions involving only a single individual. This problem is concerned with the order quantity decision of a retailer that faces probabilistic demand. Then, we consider a simple manufacturer-retailer supply chain where the retailer faces the newsvendor problem, and her problem parameters are determined by the contract that the manufacturer offers. This scenario allows us to study what happens to decisions when two individuals interact strategically with each other . Course discussion is based on results from decision-making experiments with human subjects. In addition to published research papers, we also use data from experiments conducted at Sabanci University."]}
