The materials are designed to strenghten studentsâ€™ reading skills, increase their vocabulary, refine and expand their knowledge of sentence construction and the Arabic verb system, and widen their cultural background. Lessons are structured as follows: beginning with vocabulary acquisition , followed by a humanities related basic text (if needed the latter is preceded by background information and exercises), grammatical explanations and drills, additional reading texts, review drills and suggested speaking and writing activities. Learners should have done at least two years of Arabic prior to starting with the course. According to the CEF, the level would be the equivalent of Level B1All the texts use clear language, useful vocabulary and appropriate grammar suited to this level. This ensures that the course remains sufficiently demanding to take the learner to the next level."]}
