Does gender influence the production of scientific knowledge and its content? What kind of an impact did the entering of women into science and engineering have? What is “gendered science”? This course aims to investigate these and related questions. It starts by introducing the concept of gender and how science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) and this concept are related to each other in general. It then examines the historical exclusion of women from these fields, their experiences and struggles against it as well as the scientific, technological and socio-economic costs of this exclusion. Finally, it explores the policies and “best practices” that eliminate gender biases in STEM fields, their affects in the further development of STEM fields and the new areas of research that arose as a result of these efforts."]}
