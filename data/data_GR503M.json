Students in this course will be observed by a supervisor or another observer at least once per semester in order to provide feedback on the student’s teaching performance as well as have the option to participate in additional professional development activities. Students will continue helping out with one or more courses offered at the University, which will allow them to apply the principles learned in this and previous courses."]}
