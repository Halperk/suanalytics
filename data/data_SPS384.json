Thus, along with ecological knowledge, which forms the backbone of environmental sciences,  students are also introduced to subjects such as environmental ethics and aesthetics.", "This course introduces the essence of ecological crisis and environmental problems, and science and policy aspects of the environmental issues, especially of global climate change. Climate change is not only the most alarming planetary challenge, but also is at the nexus of the debate around international politics, environmental law, social movements and the search for sustainable economic alternatives. This course equips students with the skills and methodologies to use the basic notions of environmental politics such as ecological citizenship and environmental justice, which are also among the novel concepts in political theory . International environmental politics, green and environmental movements, climate governance and food politics are among the topics to be discussed."]}
