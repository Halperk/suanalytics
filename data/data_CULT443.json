This course explores the gendered aspects of wars, militarism, and peace politics. The first part of the course, War, Militarism and Gender, focuses on the ways in which wars, militaries and military service have shaped gendered self understandings in the 20th century. The second part, Women and Peace, is based on a historical survey of women's peace activism in different parts of the world. The third section, Feminism and Peace Politics, highlights feminist theorizing on peace and peace politics. For the possibility of taking this course as a graduate seminar, see CULT 643."]}
