The course will provide an analytical history of contemporary artworks from the late 20th Century to the 21st Century, comparing curatorial approaches, artists' challenges and aesthetics. The influence of major art movements from the beginning and middle of the 20thCentury will be compared with late 20th Century art, contemporary visual practices and contemporary digital culture. Students will develop an understanding of curatorial and artistic practices as well as an aesthetic vocabulary and familiarity with the practice based and theoretical issues related to contemporary art and curatorial practices."]}
