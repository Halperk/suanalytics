The topics covered during the lectures will be applied through homeworks and a course project. Techniques for analytical surfaces representation and modeling, surface creation techniques in CAD environment, theoretical aspects of toolpath computation for 3 and 5 axis milling, 3 and 5 axis milling toolpath computation operations offered by commercial CAM packages, theoretical and practical aspects of post processing issues for 3 and 5 axis milling will be covered. Process modeling for simulation and verification of 3 and 5 axis milling processes will be covered. Project groups will select sample geometries requiring 3 and 5 axis milling. Then, they will prepare operations for machining of these sample parts using commercially available Siemens NX and CATIA packages to manufacture the selected parts on the 5-axis machine tool available in Manufacturing Research Laboratory or on the 6- axis machining robots available at SU-IMC."]}
