This semester our focus will again be two-fold. Through recent documentaries, we will be looking at the current issues and debates in the world of non-fiction filmmaking, as well as practical challenges faced by filmmakers. Throughout the semester, various filmmakers will be invited to present and discuss their work. On the practice side, each student will have an opportunity to experiment with representation of reality by making a short non-fiction film and presenting it at various stages in a workshop format."]}
