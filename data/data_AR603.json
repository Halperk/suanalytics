After a brief grounding in pragmatic worldview, this course emphasizes an experiential approach.  Through the use of articles, books, cases, video and live-interviews with senior action researchers, students will become familiar with a selection of contemporary approaches of action research, selecting one for a deeper application to enrich their own field projects.The student is successful in this course when they link their personal leadership development to their learning edge within their own field project.
