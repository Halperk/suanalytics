Then the focus is production- related metrology mainly based on dimensional measurement applications such as displacement, flatness and gauge block interferometric-mechanical measurements, diameter, form and surface texture standards measurements, scale and displacement sensor calibrations, coordinate metrology (CMMs), in-process measurements, optical tooling, nanometrology (atomic scale measurements), machine tool metrology, angle metrology and uncertainty calculations. Principles for precision engineering applications will also be covered including preliminary errors in dimensional metrology and motion mechanism , Abbe principle and applications conforming this principle and self- elimination/separation of errors, metrology loop , influence of temperature, force and vibration in dimensional measurements and precautions for precision engineering to lower the uncertainty of measurements. Laboratory exercises will be carried out with selected examples such as calibration of CNC machine tools using laser interferometers, effective use of reference standards for manufacturing and angular axis calibration of rotary tables using optical components and non-contact measurement equipment."]}
