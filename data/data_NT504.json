This module aims to provide a multi-dimensional perspective on nanotechnology. The module is designed in 3 parts; (1) commercialization of nanotechnology in the user markets, (2) health, safety and environmental (HSE) impacts of nanotechnology, and (3) national policies towards nanotechnology. National nanotechnology policies of particular developed (US, UK, Germany, Japan, South Korea etc.) and developing countries (China, India, Israel, Iran etc.) will be discussed in various dimensions such as the entire system and its actors, strategic focus areas, governance mechanisms, intermediary agencies, R&D support policies, budget allocation, commercialization strategies and HSE policies."]}
