This course will enable graduate students to reflect on their first semester helping out with a course, plan for the coming semester, and develop new skills in areas such a teaching with technology and grading.  Through a series of workshops, graduate students will learn about best practices in teaching and learning, and how to apply them to the current student population at Sabanci University. Students will continue to helping out with one or more courses offered at the University, which will allow them to apply the principles learned in the workshop."]}
