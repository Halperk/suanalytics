The course will take advantage of the inherent multi-disciplinary nature of multimedia by covering the basics including; computer hardware and peripherals, file formats, resolution and color, screen composition, photography, graphic design, concept development, flowcharting, storyboarding, visualization techniques, presentation formats, production methods, desktop publishing and the principles of user interface design in general. No prior computer experience beyond the word processor is expected."]}
