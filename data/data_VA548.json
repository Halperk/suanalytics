Special Effects as well as the manipulation of type and imagery will be a central issue throughout this course. The software to be primarily used is Combustion by Discreet. The student will also be brought into contact with both studio and outdoor video shooting; the usage of cameras and lights in a studio environment as well as in real environmental settings. Real-life simulative projects will be given to design students, whilst art students will be encouraged to apply the media in a self expressive context.", "The student is introduced to the principles and elements of motion design through studio practices. This course emphasizes on the relationship between typography principles and animation fundamentals. Students relate their experimental videos with kinetic typography to synthesize the language of motion between text and image for time-based media. Graduate students can take this course to realize their term and thesis project."]}
