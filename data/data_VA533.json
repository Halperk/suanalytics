Conversely, it has been argued that technologies have been invented in order to provide a means of apparently satisfying a demand which has been generated by art. This course will review these various conceptualisations of the relations and perhaps non-relations between art and technology. As the goals of art have shifted or redefined, the relations between art and culture have also altered. The course will therefore consider these shifts too in order to arrive at a better understanding of the stakes of the practice and the criticism of art today."]}
